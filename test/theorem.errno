[same as theorem.err, but use different I in id theorem and definition of I, which should cause last theorem to fail]

theorem id
   ∀A∊Ψ 
      (S K K A) = A
   proof
      (S K K A) = (K A (K A)) 
                = A ▮

define I as (S K S)

theorem test
   ∀X∊Ψ 
      (I X) = X
   proof
      (I X) = (S K K X) by reduce
            = X by id ▮
