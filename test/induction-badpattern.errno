define I as (S K K)

theorem id
      ∀ A ∊ Ψ (I A) = A
   proof
      (I A) = (S K K A) = (K A (K A)) = A ▮

let set X have K and (I (I T)) where T is from X

theorem xisk
   ∀A∊X ∀B,C ∊ Ψ
      (A B C) = B
   proof by induction on A
      if A is K then
         (A B C) = (K B C) = B
      if A is (I (I (I Ap))) then
         (A B C) 
            = (I Ap B C)
            = (Ap B C) by id
            = B by induction hypothesis ▮
