things that will likely be implicit for now:

let set Ψ have S, K and (A B) where A and B are from Ψ

axiom reduce
   ∀A,B,C∊Ψ (S A B C) = (A C (B C))

axiom reduce [both have the same name for now in reduction]
   ∀A,B∊Ψ (K A B) = A

axiom E1
   ∀A∊Ψ A = A

axiom E2
   ∀A,B,C ∊ Ψ 
      A = B ∧ B = C → A = C
