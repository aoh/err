[only one induction branch, CT can be defined later]

let set SX have S, K and (S X) where X is from SX

theorem my-identity
   ∀A,B∊SX (S K A B) = B
proof by induction on A [just to test it, no need for induction hypothesis]
   if A is K then
      (S K K B) = (K B (K B)) = B 
   if A is S then
      (S K S B) = (K B (S B)) = B
   if A is (S x) then
      (S K (S x) B) = (K B (S x B)) = B ▮
