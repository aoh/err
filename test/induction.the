define I as (S K K)

let set Is have I and (Z I) where Z is from Is

theorem test 
   ∀a∊Ψ ∀X∊Is (X a) = a

[ should construct a proof like
   proof by induction on X
      if X is I then
         (X a) = (I a) = (S K K a) = (K a (K a)) = a
      if X is (Y I) then
         (Y I a) = (I a) by induction hypothesis = (S K K a) = (K a (K a)) = a ▮
