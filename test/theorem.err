[prove that all (S K ?) are identity functions, define I as one make a proof using the general id]

theorem id
   ∀A,B∊Ψ 
      (S K A B) = B
   proof
      (S K A B) = (K B (A B)) 
                = B ▮

define I as (S K K)

theorem test
   ∀X∊Ψ 
      (I X) = X
   proof
      (I X) = (S K K X) by reduce
            = X by id ▮
